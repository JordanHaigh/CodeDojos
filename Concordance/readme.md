# Concordance Kata

A concordance (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordance_%28publishing%29) is an alphabetical list of the principal words used in a
 book or body of work, listing every instance of each word with its
  immediate context. 
  
  Only works of special importance have had 
  concordances prepared for them, such as the Vedas,
  Bible, Qur'an or the works of Shakespeare or classical Latin and
   Greek authors, because of the time, difficulty, and expense involved
    in creating a concordance in the pre-computer era.
