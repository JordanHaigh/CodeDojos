# Method Auto-Completion

Based on ideas presented in http://rubyquiz.com/quiz110.html

# The Problem

Most modern IDEs implement some form of "auto-completion" of programming syntax.
Auto-completion is when you type a partial member name, and after a short delay, the possible members matched by your text are displayed.

We want to build a command line application that mimics auto-complete in the language of your choice.

###C# Example

    > autocomplete.exe
    > Enter Typename: string
    > Enter Stub: To
    > Possible Members:
    >     ToString
    >     ToSomethingElse
